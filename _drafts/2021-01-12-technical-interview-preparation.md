After finishing one year-intensive-master program (master for engineering leadership - dependable software system, DSS-MEL at UBC), I found myself more interested in searching for a technical work rather than managing work. To be clear, the MEL program is designed to provide 60% of technical stuffs and 40% of coursework is about business stuffs. This is an awesome and unique program to learn about lots of fundamental knowledge to build a resilience software system from both points of view of an engineer and a business leader. However, after a year of study and almost 15 years of working in software industry, I understand that the heart of a product is built from technical based knowledge. Without it, no matter how good a leader is, the product (or the company) cannot live in long time. That is the reason I wanted to spend an extra semester for self-study, to recall my under graduate computer science knowledge before jumping into software industry again. I hope that I could find a solid software developer role in big companies, so I could learn from the world class developers in this new country.

That's reason I started my repository "technical interview preparation". This repository is not to compete with tons of interview preparation reposition out there in github, it is just simply a place to store my own solutions while preparing for my up coming technical interviews (if there is)
